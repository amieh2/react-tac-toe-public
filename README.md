# React-Tac-Toe

This module is a Tic-Tac-Toe game played in the browser, completed as part of a [course](http://arch-joelross.rhcloud.com/) at the UW ISchool. 

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission!


##### 1. Does using a Model-View-Controller architecture make it easier to change your game in the future? How many places would you need to make changes to your code to make this a 5x5 game of Tic-Tac-Toe?
> Answer goes here!


##### 2. Why did I say that an `Array` is the best data structure to represent the game's grid of cells? Why not a 2D-array (Array of Arrays), or an Object, or a Linked-List, or a Tree? 
> Answer goes here!


##### 3. What online resources did you find to help you learn React? How do you search for resources, and how did you determine whether they were helpful or not? Think back to the "learning an API" paper! 
> I googled React.js to find resources on how to learn React. I mainly used stack overflow as a resource because it has example of code written which is easier for me to learn and follow from. Having these written examples were helpful when working on the assignment.


##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> This assignment took me around 15 hours to complete.


##### 5. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I didnt recieve any help from classmates but I received help from a javascript tutor on this assignment because I was having difficulties getting started. 


##### 6. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I found the React library difficult to learn, I would recommend more time reveiwing the library in class before giving out the assignmnet.
